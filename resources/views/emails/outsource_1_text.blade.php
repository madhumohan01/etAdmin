Hi,

I work for eTangerine Technologies and manage sales operations at our Toronto branch.

I came across your advertisement in craigslist looking for a {{ $job_position }}. I felt that you might be interested in our services and decided to contact you.

We can help you set up an offshore team working in your time zone. And we can do this without any risk to your business. Just set up your team and try it out 7 days for free. You can scale up  your team on demand, get the best talent and reduce your cost by upto 60%. 

If this is something that you are interested in, letâ€™s set up a quick call to discuss further. You can email me (by replying to this mail) or call me at +1 314 685 5482.

Thanks for your time. 

Best Regards, 
Madhu Mohan
