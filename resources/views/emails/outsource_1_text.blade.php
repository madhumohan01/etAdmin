Hi,

I work for eTangerine Technologies and manage sales operations of our Toronto office covering North America region.

I came across your advertisement in craigslist looking for a {{ $job_position }}. I felt that you might be interested in our services and decided to contact you.

We can help you set up an offshore team in India working in your time zone, reducing your cost by 50-60%. And we can do this without any risk to your business. Just set up your team and try it out 7 days for free. If you feel that it is not working out, you can cancel anytime. No questions asked. 

We can get you the best people for the job. You can select the right person from a pool of good candidates. In addition, we offer very flexible engagement models: monthly, quarterly or any model you feel comfortable with.

If this is something that you are interested in, letâ€™s set up a quick call to discuss further. You can email me or call me at +1 314 685 5482.

Thanks for your time. 

Best Regards, 
Madhu Mohan
